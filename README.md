# Environmental Data AI Assistants

*22-Jan-25*

The purpose of this repository is to gather together in one place a variety of configurations for AI assistants that I developed predominantly in 2024 for the purpose of analyzing and deriving sustainability related-data, primarily those related to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). I've likely modified these configurations to reflect the evolution of AI agents since then. 

My ambition in developing these tools was to have a toolbox of AI assistance to expedite the slow and difficult process of parsing through sustainability disclosures to get to the core data required for some modelling of this data.

My work in this respect was motivated largely by the desire to have this data available for simulating monetizations of environmental data. But I have continued to open source them in the hope that they might be of use to anyone else interfacing with this field.

My configurations are written mostly in natural language. In the past, I've deployed them predominantly on Hugging Face Chat. But I've also successfully used them as system prompts for agents configured using Anthropic and Google models (both using Open Web UI and more recently using Gemini Gems via Gemini Advanced). 

I don't think that there is a definitive answer as to what the best methodology for using these is. It likely changes over time. And depends upon finding a model with a capable augmented data source for retrieving this often fast changing information.
